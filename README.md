# Optimal-Warehouse-Expansion

# Introduction

This report aims to assist a small manufacturing company in **expanding its business capabilities** by suggesting a convenient location or space. The company has identified four alternative options: **A1 (Centre), A2 (Suburb), A3 (Shared), A4 (Extend)**. These alternatives are evaluated based on five different decision criteria: **C1 (Public Transport links), C2 (Parking), C3 (Warehouse), C4 (Security), and C5 (Cost)**. Selecting the best possible alternative requires a strategic methodology based on these business criteria. Making decisions using multiple criteria plays a crucial role in **improving business efficiency**. The biggest challenge in making the right business decisions is to enhance business performance while satisfying the maximum possible criteria.

In this report, I will present and justify the best possible alternative to acquire space using multi-criteria analysis methods such as **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)** and **Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)**. 

## AHP
AHP decomposes the whole business problem into a hierarchy and determines the weight coefficients by pairwise comparison. With this method, it becomes feasible to combine quantitative and qualitative factors in the decision-making process (Saaty, 1990). We must determine the relative importance of different options over others using the Saaty scale, which is a numerical value with a verbal judgment aligned with it (Saaty, 1990).
