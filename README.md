# Optimal-Warehouse-Expansion

# Introduction

This report aims to assist a small manufacturing company in **expanding its business capabilities** by suggesting a convenient location or space. The company has identified four alternative options: **A1 (Centre), A2 (Suburb), A3 (Shared), A4 (Extend)**. These alternatives are evaluated based on five different decision criteria: **C1 (Public Transport links), C2 (Parking), C3 (Warehouse), C4 (Security), and C5 (Cost)**. Selecting the best possible alternative requires a strategic methodology based on these business criteria. Making decisions using multiple criteria plays a crucial role in **improving business efficiency**. The biggest challenge in making the right business decisions is to enhance business performance while satisfying the maximum possible criteria.

In this report, I will present and justify the best possible alternative to acquire space using multi-criteria analysis methods such as **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)** and **Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)**. 

## AHP
AHP decomposes the whole business problem into a hierarchy and determines the weight coefficients by pairwise comparison. With this method, it becomes feasible to combine quantitative and qualitative factors in the decision-making process (Saaty, 1990). We must determine the relative importance of different options over others using the Saaty scale, which is a numerical value with a verbal judgment aligned with it (Saaty, 1990).

## TOPSIS

TOPSIS on the other hand is a useful technique where it ranks different available alternatives based on the Euclidean distance from the Positive Ideal Solution (PIS) or Negative Ideal Solution (NIS). The optimum solution or alternative is the one that has the shortest distance from the PIS and the longest distance from the NIS(SteviÄ‡ et al., 2015).

# Determination of comparison matrix using AHP 

Considering the given business scenario, I have assumed the criteria weights over another in the below manner: -


The weights are assumed in such a way that Warehouse space is of extreme importance and Public transport being the least one. After determining the relative importance of each decision criteria I assumed a number from the Saaty scale based on the judgement and developed a comparison matrix (Figure 2). 

# AHP Methodology

AHP calculations can be carried out using principal eigenvector or geometric mean for qualitative decision criteria.

In 1st step, the sum is calculated for each row of the comparison matrix determined above. Then the summed row is normalised. This method is repeated until the normalised value in consecutive calculations remains the same.
